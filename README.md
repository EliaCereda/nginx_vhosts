nginx_vhosts
============

Shell script to add a new vhost on nginx. Modifying the shell script available on http://www.sebdangerfield.me.uk/2012/05/nginx-and-php-fpm-bash-script-for-creating-new-vhosts-under-separate-fpm-pools/  to suit my needs.

The script was fully revisited in order to user /var/www as storage area and to create secure sftp users
